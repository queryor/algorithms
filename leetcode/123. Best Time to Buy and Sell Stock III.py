# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

# Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

# Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

# Example 1:

# Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
#              Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
# Example 2:

# Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
#              Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
#              engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
# Example 3:

# Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
# 这道是要求最多交易两次，找到最大利润，还是需要用动态规划Dynamic Programming来解，而这里我们需要两个递推公式来分别更新两个变量local和global，
# 参见网友Code Ganker的博客，我们其实可以求至少k次交易的最大利润，找到通解后可以设定 k = 2，
# 即为本题的解答。我们定义local[i][j]为在到达第i天时最多可进行j次交易并且最后一次交易在最后一天卖出的最大利润，此为局部最优。
# 然后我们定义global[i][j]为在到达第i天时最多可进行j次交易的最大利润，此为全局最优。它们的递推式为：

# local[i][j] = max(global[i - 1][j - 1] + max(diff, 0), local[i - 1][j] + diff)

# global[i][j] = max(local[i][j], global[i - 1][j])

# 其中局部最优值是比较前一天并少交易一次的全局最优加上大于0的差值，和前一天的局部最优加上差值中取较大值，而全局最优比较局部最优和前一天的全局最优
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices) -> int:
        # DP
        if len(prices)==0:
            return 0
        n = len(prices)
        g = [[0 for i in range(3)]for i in range(n)]
        l = [[0 for i in range(3)]for i in range(n)]  
        for i in range(1,n):
            diff = prices[i]-prices[i-1]
            for j in range(1,3):
                l[i][j]=max(g[i-1][j-1]+max(diff,0),l[i-1][j]+diff)
                g[i][j]=max(l[i][j],g[i-1][j])
        return g[n-1][2]
